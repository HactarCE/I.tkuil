# Roots

Unlike 2011 Ithkuil, roots will no longer always be a single consonant cluster. Some roots follow a CVC pattern, consisting of two consonant clusters separated by **É™**. (Typically the first cluster is able to operate independently as a more general root.) While at first glance this may sound similar to the noun classes of 2004 Ithkuil and 2006 Ilaksh, it does not apply to all roots and is mostly used for highly specific roots or ones that neatly fit into a certain category.
