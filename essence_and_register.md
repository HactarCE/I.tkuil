## Essence

[Formatives](morphophonology.md#formative) and [long-form PRAs](morphophonology.md#long-form) have Essence, conveyed by stress:

| Syllable count    | `NRM` Normal       | `RPV` Representative   |
|-------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| Monosyllabic (1)  | default            | N/A                    |
| Disyllabic (2)    | penultimate stress | ultimate stress        |
| Polysyllabic (≥3) | penultimate stress | antepenultimate stress |

If a word has Representative essence, the stressed vowel is marked with an acute accent (`apál`) or prefixed with an exclamation mark (`ap!al`). If a diphthong is stressed, only the first vowel is marked. Normal essence is unmarked.

## Register

All words have Register, which is conveyed by tone:

| Register              | Tone               | Unicode marking | ASCII-compatible marking |
|-----------------------|--------------------|:---------------:|:------------------------:|
| `NRR` Narrative       | falling (1)        |     (none)      |          (none)          |
| `DSV` Discursive      | high (2)           |       `˥`       |        `-` or `¯`        |
| `PTH` Parenthetical   | low (3)            |       `˩`       |           `_`            |
| `COG` Cogitant        | falling-rising (4) |       `˧˨˦`       |        `~` or `ˇ`        |
| `IPR` Impressionistic | rising-falling (5) |       `˧˦˨`       |           `^`            |

If a word does not have falling tone, tone is marked by prefixing the word with one of the corresponding symbols above.
