# Morphology

* [Morphological Hierarchy](#morphological-hierarchy)

The morphology is copied directly from [2011 Ithkuil](http://www.ithkuil.net/). [Here is an up-to-date reference sheet.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11luFPZI03IB9-mGGQ6L2C1eNHpHP6skmsjrMeAfCU-M/edit)

## Morphological Hierarchy

Grammatical categories are conceptually applied in the following order:

* Root + Pattern/Stem/Designation
* Function
* Configuration/Affiliation
* Perspective
* Version
* Valence
* Extension
* Incorporated root(s), in the order they are spoken
* Suffixes (including Modality, Level, and additional Configuration/Affiliation/Perspective)
  * Suffixes attached to the end of a word, in the order they are spoken
    * If a formative has only two suffixes, type 1/type 2 followed by type 3, the type 3 suffix is applied first
  * Suffixes before the word, in the order they are spoken
* Modality
* Aspect
* Mood
* Validation
* Sanction
* Essence
* Case
* Context
* Bias
* Register
