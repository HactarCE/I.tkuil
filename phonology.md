## Consonants

Where consonants appear in pairs, the one to the right is voiced. Otherwise, fricatives are unvoiced and all other sounds are voiced.

|               | Nasal  | Plosive | Fricative | Approximant |
|---------------|:------:|:-------:|:---------:|:-----------:|
| Bilabial      |   m    |   p b   |           |             |
| Labio-dental  |        |         |    f v    |             |
| Dental        |        |  (t d)  | .t/ţ .d/ḑ |             |
| Alveolar      |   n    |   t d   |    s z    |      r      |
| Post-alveolar |        |         |    c j    |     (r)     |
| Palatal       |        |         |   hy/ẙ    |      y      |
| Labiovelar    |        |         |   hw/ẘ    |      w      |
| Velar/uvular  |  .n/ŋ  |   k g   |     x     |             |
| Glottal       |        |    '    |     h     |             |
| Lateral       |        |         |   hl/l̥    |      l      |

**r** may also be pronounced as an alveolar flap, in which case it becomes an alveolar trill when geminated.

All consonants can be geminated, except for plosives, **h**, **w**, and **y**. Geminated consonants are pronounced for a slightly longer period of time.

When digraphs are geminated, only the first symbol is repeated. For example, **.l** becomes **..l** and **hw** becomes **hhw**.

Word-initial nasals followed by a plosive or fricative are syllabic, as well as word-initial **l** when not followed immediately by a vowel.

## Vowels

Front and central vowels are unrounded; back vowels may be rounded

|      |  Front  |  Central   |  Back   |
|------|:-------:|:----------:|:-------:|
| High | i /i~ɪ/ |            |  u /u/  |
| Mid  |  e /ɛ/  | .e/ə /ɜ~ʌ/ | o /o~o̞/ |
| Low  |         |  a /a~ɑ/   |         |

Diphthongs:

* ai ei oi
* au eu

Disyllabic vowel-vowel combinations:

* ea eo oa oe
* ia ie io iu
* ua ue uo ui

Disallabic diphthong-vowel combinations (diphthong comes first):

* aia aie aiu aio
* eia eie eiu eio
* oia oie oiu oio

Altogether this yields 35 permissible vowel formations. Since **wu** and **yi** are really hard to pronounce, making **u** and **i** (or any diphthongs starting with them) interchangeable yields 30.

## Tones

Tones are described in the section covering [Essence](essence_and_register.md#essence).
