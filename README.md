**This project has been abandoned in favor of [Yalbi](https://github.com/HactarCE/Yalbi/), a language based on Ithkuil with the goal of preserving sanity.

# I.tkuil

This is not [Ithkuil](http://ithkuil.net/). [Ithkuil](http://ithkuil.net/) is a constructed language by John Quijada. This is a fork of Ithkuil, designed by a completely different person, with the goal of making Ithkuil more logical and more pronounceable. This project is not complete yet.
