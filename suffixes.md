# Suffixes

For now, just use the suffixes listed on JQ's website, making the changes listed below.

The legendary `SSD` Stem Specific Derivational suffix will be retiring, and in its place is a new system that's kinda like noun classes? The [roots list](roots.md) explains it better. Additionally, since [CVf](#affixes.md#cvf) is already able to take any case value, the Format Expansion Suffixes are no longer needed. The modality suffixes have also been cut and will be replaced by a smaller set of similar suffixes at some point in the future.

Make the following character conversions:

* c → ts
* č → tc
* dh → ḑ
* j → dj
* ļ → l̥
* ň → ŋ
* š → c
* ž → j
* ż → dz

In order to fit a more limited phonology, the following suffixes have been temporarily assigned new values:
